# Home Rentals Initiative

This project serves as a comprehensive marketplace for rental properties of various sorts. Whether you're an agent looking to list properties or someone searching for the perfect rental, this platform is designed to make the process seamless and secure.

## General Overview

Our primary goal is to facilitate a reliable and user-friendly marketplace for rental properties. We aim to:

* Allow agents to update and manage available properties.
* Connect individuals looking for rental properties with agents.
* Serve as an escrow system to ensure the security of transactions between renters and agents.

The back and forth involved in finding a new rental space in Nigeria is tiring; wether home rentals, office rentals, event space rentals, it is just a pain. We aim to eradicate this problem by setting the stage of a marketplace, where verified agents and users can connect.

## Features

Here are some of the key features that make the Home Rentals Initiative stand out:

* Virtual Tour: Experience properties through virtual tours without leaving your home.
* Physical Inspection: Schedule physical inspections easily through the platform.
* User Roles and Plans: Different levels and roles for users, including various plans for agents.
* Per Role Dashboard: Different Dashboards based on roles of the user, eg. Agents.
* Advanced Filtering: Use different API routes to filter through properties based on various criteria.
* Secure Transactions: An escrow system to ensure all transactions are secure and trustworthy.

## Initial Idea
HOME RENTALS will be a one-stop-shop for all real estate needs, offering listings for residential, commercial, and industrial properties. Users will be able to search for properties, connect with landlords or sellers, and even complete transactions online. Our platform will also provide value-added services such as property management for landlords and financing options for buyers.
